    <p class="text1"> For our semester project we developed a con-
        cept for a concert hall situated in the Horses-
        hoe Bend in Arizona. The construction site is lo-
        cated in a canyon that is surrounded by semi-arid
        land, raised plateaus and the Colorado River.
        The materials available in the area are different
        types of sedimentary rocks and mostly sandstone. The
        character of the project is defined by the materiali-
        ty that is strongly interconnected with discussions
        concerning excavation and transportation processes,
        the usage of the provided material as well as the mat-
        ter of economy in architecture. Economy in the sense
        of efficient material management as well as a radi-
        cal structural configuration of the designed spaces.
        Both the city and the concert hall are following the
        principle of building with and in the stone by using
        existing rock formations or the extracted material,
        creating buildings integrated into the landscape. The
        development of the project was determined by seve-
        ral studies on the material and its properties, the
        different techniques of material extraction and the
        significance of stone in the architectural practice.
        The decision to construct the buildings inside the rocks
        of the canyon was due to the materialÂ´s ability to regu-
        late temperatures and thus pose an energy efficient way
        of designing, while creating a shelter/protection from
        the unpredictable weather conditions at the same time.
        The concert hall is built at a height of 178 meters
        above ground, most parts of the building are ent-
        irely built in the canyon and the design follows
        an organic approach. The negative spaces resulted
        from the extraction of the material form the most
        important parts of the building, for instance the
        two foyers. The five concert halls are either direct-
        ly connected to the foyers or through tunnel cor-
        ridors leading to the entrance of the given hall.
        Each hall serves a different purpose and has its own
        character while in the end all rooms find a mutual
        connection in the central foyer, a central meeting
        point for the visitors and the core of the building.
