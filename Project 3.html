    <p class="text1"> Rivers belong to their cities.
        The „Wienfluss“ the river that gave the city Vienna its
        name, was since the early 1800s increasingly reined
        in, its banks consolidated, bricked, and concreted. In
        the late 1800s, using extreme measures, it was built
        over, enclosed, and hidden from view. With temperatu-
        res rising all over the world and water supplies dimi-
        nishing, cities need to retain all the water they can.
        We investigated methods of retaining the water of the Wien-
        fluss, rendering it more visible and letting it out to play.
        My project, Protect-Collect-Distribute-Connect,
        aims to transform the urban space between Rüdige-
        rhof and Kettenbrückengasse U4 station in Vienna.
        By making use of fog catchers and fog machines, the
        project reinterprets the concept of their use and
        extends it to the communal area. The supports of
        the project are designed to pierce the foundati-
        ons of the Wien River and enter its riverbed. This
        way, the buried Wien River is not only brought back
        to the surface symbolically but also physically.
        The supports collect water from the river, pump it up to
        the surface, and redistribute it with the help of fog ma-
        chines. The supports also serve as a structure for a ten-
        sioned net, collecting and storing water at low points.
        The project offers a unique experience for visitors
        as they encounter the water from both above and below.
