<p class="text1"> Exploring the interrelation of body and space.
    One of the main interests was to identi-
    fy spaces that are generated by bodies in motion.
    We therefore tracked our body very closely while moving.
    How can we document and translate movements to create spaces?
    Is it possible to transfer dyna-
    mic processes into static structures?
    The aim was to start a dialogue between a bo-
    dyÂ´s behavior, the use and configurati-
    on of a space, and their mutual dependence.
    We tried to create a common playground, therefore the goal
    was first to design a playable object/space and after-
    ward collaborate with other students and their objects.
    The final step was to organize our play structures in the
    format of an exhibition. A few of the objects got further
    developed and prototypes were constructed in a 1:1 scale.
    My Play Object developed into a structure with dif-
    ferent densitys and has a wide range of use ca-
    ses including climbing, hanging objects, and view-
    ing. This makes the object versatile, allowing users
    to approach it without dictating a specific use.
    Thedifferent densitys lets the user explore the
    structure , seeking for passages for movement.
