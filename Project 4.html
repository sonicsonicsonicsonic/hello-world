        The forest is a very special place. When I visit
        it, all my senses come alive—smell, sound, touch
        —everything is perceived intensely. By crea-
        ting more sensitivity through impressive
        experiences in the forest, you engage all your
        senses and experience the forest as a whole.
        This holistic engagement fosters grea-
        ter sensitivity and awareness for the natural
        environment. In architecture, dynamics can be unders-
        tood in two ways: as an object in motion and as a
        process involving change, growth, or develop-
        ment. By integrating these dynamic principles, my
        architectural design seeks to mimic the forest’s
        ability to stimulate the senses and evolve over
        time. The exoskeleton of the bubbles is connected
        to trees with ropes. When the trees move in the
        wind, the exoskeleton deforms in a chain-like pat-
        tern, making the pneumatic shells feel „alive.“
        Inside these shells, a highly sensory experien-
        ce is created. While one cannot see the forest,
        they can hear it and feel it through the moving
        shapes. It is like being in a tent—protected, yet
        deeply connected to the forest. Furthermore the
        sleeping and sanitary bubbles are separated,
        requiring one to step outside to access the fa-
        cilities, further immersing them in the natural
        environment. The growth of the structure is envisioned
        to align with the interests of the residents or the
        institute. Prefabricated steel modules allow
        for easy assembly, forming a path through the
        forest. This dynamic interplay between form and
        function creates a living architecture, fostering a
        deep, sensory connection to the natural world
        and promoting continuous growth and awareness.
